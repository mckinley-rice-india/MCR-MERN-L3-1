# Mckinley & Rice NodeJs and Full Stack MERN DeveloperCoding Challenge

> Welcome to the Mckinley & Rice Coding Challenge!


## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a  web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

This challenge is expected to take about 2-3 hours.


# MERN Stack Developer Coding Challenge

The purpose of this coding challenge is to test a candidate's ability to
write concise, correct, elegant, robust and efficient code carrying the
duties of a *MERN* (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js) Stack
Developer. Also to familiarise the tools and libraries we will be using.

## Technologies

- MongoDB 3.4.x
- Express.js 4.16.x
- React
- Node.js v8.x (Use [.nvmrc](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage)
- ES6
- Webpack

## Libraries

- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) OR [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) - MongoDB connector
- [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) - *Optional, provides a rich Promise API
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - *Optional, make HTTP calls easier
- React

## Testing

- [jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine) - Unit Test
- [protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor) - End-to-end Test

## Bonus

- Use of ES8 async/await
- Use of WebSocket using socket.io OR uWebSockets
- Mock responses based on environment development (for testing) vs production (from MongoDB)

## Task

- Develop a simple chat room that allows multiple people to join, data should persist
- User can Create room 
- user can join and leave rooms at any time
- Caching and optimisations will be a plus
- Making use of all the technologies at your disposal
- Leaving implementations open to interpretation as a test for making architectural decisions.
- It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.
